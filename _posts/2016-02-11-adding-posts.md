When I decided to set up this personal page/blog thing, after a quick search I decided on hosting it on [GitHub](http://github.com). To do it, I have followed this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), that shows step by step how to set up the repository and gives an introduction on how to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). By using Jekyll I can use Markdown to write posts, which simplifies things a lot. Let's see how far this actually goes!

I am using a variation of [PanosSakkos' { Personal } Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) for my timeline.

To post Jupyter Notebooks, I am using [cscorley's IPython to Jekyll markdown](https://gist.github.com/cscorley/9144544).
